# TablutGo
Runs on Python3 exclusively!

1. Make sure you have `python3` (recommended `3.6.x`) and `pip3`. Install packages via these commands:
```
pip3 install numpy               [numpy]
sudo apt-get install python3-tk  [tkinter]
pip3 install tensorflow          [tensorflow]
pip3 install pillow              [PIL]
pip3 install matplotlib          [matplotlib]
```
2. Navigate to the main folder, and run via the following command:
```
./TablutGo ${BLACK, WHITE}$ $TIMEOUT$ $SERVER_IP$
```
3. You are good to go!

**Note:** some warnings may appear due to the tensorflow library. These can be ignored, and should not affect gameplay.
